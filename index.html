              handle it. You‚Äôve done it before; you‚Äôll do it again. I believe in
              you, always. If you ever feel overwhelmed; you‚Äôll always have me
              to lean on. I‚Äôll be here to help you; cheer you on; and put a
              smile on your face when things feel heavy. And don‚Äôt worry about
              my problems; as long as you‚Äôre okay, I‚Äôm okay. That‚Äôs all that
              matters to me. I will give you all the support you need; I‚Äôll
              always be here if you need help in CSS. üòù And if you‚Äôre tired
              from school, don‚Äôt hesitate to chat with me; I‚Äôll treat you
              milktea and takoyaki. üòä Always prioritize your mental health;
              your studies, and your happiness. You‚Äôre stronger than you think,
              I know it. Keep doing what you love, what makes you happy, as long
              as it doesn‚Äôt hurt you or anyone else. I‚Äôll always give you my
              full support. And if you ever feel like a burden... run to me. I
              love your presence more than anyone. ‚ù§Ô∏è Lastly, I want you to
              know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so proud of you. You‚Äôve done so great these past years.
              I wish for you to improve more, learn more, and grow even more ‚Äî
              in your own time. I‚Äôll always give you the love you need. I‚Äôll
              always watch you grow.. I swear it. And I‚Äôll always love you; even
              without needing anything in return. ü§ó No matter what happens,
              you‚Äôll always have someone quietly cheering you on from the
              background... that‚Äôs me. From Epi Louis Badilla, who loves you
